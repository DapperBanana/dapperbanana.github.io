WORK EXPERIENCE:

Heartland Generation
Calgary, AB
Business Analyst
May 2022 – Present

Projects:
    - Operational Data Portal: In a team of 3, with the help of key field assets, we built a portal for Heartlands operations team both in the field and at head office. This website allowed the field to manually edit site specific fleet metrics, included a site approval chain for all edits, and even cleanse outage information that was automatically gathered from site-specific SCADA data. Meanwhile the site allowed head office to view PowerBI reports in-browser that pulled from all authorized and approved data in the data warehouse. As SAML SSO was enabled, each employee had a specific view that was tailored to their position within the company. All of this saving 1 Senior FTE resource worth of time and ensuring data integrity at every bend.
    - Velocity Data Extraction Pipeline: I designed and built a data extraction pipeline utilizing web scraping, ODATA connectors, Azure Function Apps, and more for the operational MOC and incident tracking system (VelocityEHS), saving over $5k in annual data request and report improvement fees
    - Front Office Finance Web App: I designed and, while managing a Jr. Developer, built Heartlands first Blazor web app with PowerBI integration and SAML SSO for the finance front office team, reducing report building time by an average of 4 days per month and creating the new template for all Blazor web apps to come
    - Payroll Log Book Automation: I designed and built an end-to-end solution for payroll that included an Excel app for data entry, a SharePoint site for data hosting, and an Azure logic app for data ingestion and processing in order to automate field operation vehicle log book reporting; This resulted in a savings of over 1 full week of data processing every month for that team

Data management and analysis are also at the core of my responsibilities.
