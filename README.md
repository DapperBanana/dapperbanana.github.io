Welcome to my GitHub Pages repository! This repository hosts the HTML code for my personal portfolio website.

## About Me

I'm Austin L. Howard, an above-average code monkey with below-average potassium levels. Currently working as a Business Analyst at Heartland Generation, my day-to-day activities involve everything from building .NET 6 Azure Function Apps to managing company projects and IS initiatives. Here's a glimpse into my daily routine:

- Sipping on my 8th coffee of the day while coding.
- Pulling out hair while setting up Blazor web apps (or any web apps really).
- Counting ceiling tiles while managing company projects.
- Spending evenings with the gentle hum of server fans when something inevitably breaks.
- Enjoying bottles of whiskey after a Friday production deployment.

While I'm currently employed full-time and unable to take on contract work, I'm always open to building new relationships in the industry. I have a soft spot for helping people out and love making new friends.
