                <p>
                    Like most companies, Heartland had many different processes all running in different departments in tandem
                    in order to create specific monthly/quarterly/yearly reports. Taking on a project this large is typically
                    not something I've seen many development groups be willing to take on. Our department was small, though,
                    comprising of a remote contractor, our senior data architect, and myself. While small, none of us back
                    down from a challenge and our architect, Simon Wong, is well known for taking on large tasks so we happily 
                    took on the challenge. Our main goal was to create an automated pipeline that would gather as much data as 
                    possible and hopefully create all of the operations departments needed reports without all of the leg work 
                    that was done every month. (It became so intense that they ended up hiring a specialist full time just to 
                    create this monthly report)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course there are always concessions to be made and we ended up making a few. While it would be a dream
                    to be able to automate the entire report we did end up needing some manual intervention on some records. Due
                    to that we had to then create an approval structure so that changes could be made and verified (along with
                    the multiple intermediary tables and calculations for checks and balances along the way).
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our rag tag team though we were able to create a reliable pipeline that extracted SCADA information from 
                    the field sites, combined that with publicly available AESO data, and then allowed our field operators (within a 
                    predefined approval structure) to go in and edit any outages or metrics that we may have automatically detected 
                    in case explanation was needed that could not be provided through our raw data pull. From the field operators 
                    perspective that meant that they no longer had to duplicate data from their hand written notes over to excel 
                    spreadsheets and then over again into these excel monthly reports and on and on and on. No, thankfully they'd 
                    only have to verify information before the monthly reports went out; Which, of course, automatic notifications
                    were sent out to ensure the operators, shift supervisors, and foremen didn't forget to verify.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While all of this is going on, we still need to talk about the lovely people back at HQ. These folks are also 
                    needing to see data, and the sooner the better. Since this info was always locked behind spreadsheet after 
                    spreadsheet (sometimes saved to Sharepoint, sometimes saved locally), there was never a reliable way to gather
                    data as the month was progressing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (My personal goal is to rid the world of its dependance on Excel but I think the almighty Gates is winning that one)
                </p>
                <p>
                    So once we had that data inside the warehouse, we were able to then go and create a dynamic report that built and
                    forcasted as the month, quarter, and year progressed. While the report itself was created in PowerBI I embedded
                    this into the site so it could become a one stop shop for all things related to this Operations report.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As this was servicing such a wide range of employee types, we added in SAML SSO for security as well as dynamic menus
                    so that while the portal stayed the same, each position within the company had a tailored experience.

                    It seems to be that most SaaS companies out there are able to build out a platform that both entices and traps.
                    Not that that's a bad thing, but I find that often the case is that your company seems to do something that 
                    allegedly no other company in the world does. Of course this means customization... Well... Customization and
                    SaaS means $$$. They go together about as well as water and oil some times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution that I had at the time was that our MOC (management of change) and incident tracking system would
                    have it's data extracted and tossed into our data warehouse. Once it's there I can gladly help people create 
                    any sort of report their heart desires. Problem: Most of the data (that we own) is locked behind a paywall.
                    We of course paid it and extracted what we could out of their ODATA connector (thank you Azure Logic Apps for
                    timing and Azure Function Apps for the extract). That being said, not all of the data we had was included in 
                    this daily extract. To remedy this our good old friend, web scraping, came into play in order to extract files,
                    missing data, headers, essentially any information that we owned that our management system was unable to get 
                    us easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the initial pull I could hash files, check for any changes, insert data where needed... It was glorious!
                    It became handy enough that we saved about $5k/year on data requests and then about $10k/year on application 
                    changes to their reporting module within the software.

                <p>
                    When I first started at Heartland we were using Vue.JS for all of our web apps and... While there's nothing
                    wrong with JavaScript (*looks around*... "Did the JS fanatics put their pitchforks down?") if your entire
                    stack is written in C# it's a hell of a lot nicer to use something that doesn't require context switching
                    (not that we're not capable of it). So we decided to experiment with a few different technologies and I ended
                    up wanting to experiment with Blazor as my next project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to largely attempt to create our existing web app style but just with a Blazor WebAssembly web app.
                    During this period of time we had a summer student working for us as a Jr. Dev so I was able to architect a 
                    game plan on implementing this, set up some tasks, and then work with our summer student to create our new
                    Blazor WebAssembly template.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We needed a couple things on this like SAML SSO integration with Azure, PowerBI integration for reporting,
                    dynamic data entry forms, amongst other standard web app components that we used internally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After about 3-4 weeks we had a working demo and were able to start work on implementing the DevOps pipeline
                    for automated testing and deployment. Working off of that we managed to get the web app to a state where 
                    the former Excel-based 3-day-long task was now reduced to about a 30 min verification of data once a month.

                <p>
                    Do you like American border security? Yeah... Me neither. I do, however, have a love for radio and have been 
                    lucky enough to work at the RCMP as a radio technologist. While I was at the RCMP I got to work with a lot of
                    cool and fun tech, some of that being some Harris P25 systems (as the emergency service radio geeks will know);
                    Though I suppose now they're known as "L3Harris". Regardless, when it comes to border security it's no surprise
                    that governments work together to ensure safety. This typically means creating interoperability between disperate
                    technologies. In our case it was interfacing our P25 systems with the US's legacy radio systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep in mind I can only speak at a relatively high level for this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In, possibly my favorite project to date, I was able to work with RCMP, American Border Security, Harris, and more
                    to design my own PCB that allowed for interoperability between our systems and theirs. Not only this but I was able
                    to design and project manage the creation of a new radio tower along the border to service both Canada and the US.
                    Working within the bounds of both countries very rigid regulations was not an easy task but it was possibly one of
                    the most rewarding I've taken on. To be able to know that it was my work that keeps part of the border safe, that
                    something that emergency services to this day use something that I designed... It was a pleasure to be able to 
                    offer my services and I hope one day to be able to contribute something like this to society again.

                <p>
                    After disparaging myself for this entire website, let me blow some steam up my own ass for a second here. I 
                    have a deep love of learning. Yes, a lot of people do. I do though to the extent where it's caused issues in 
                    my personal life. Over time I've learned to reign in my interests and focus on a couple things at a time. At
                    this point in my life I'd like to think that I've gotten pretty good at this tightrope walk of following my
                    passions and not going to the hospital for sleep deprivation. (Though late night Age of Empires sessions do 
                    tempt me still!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life, like many things, is about balance. Unfortunately, in today's world it seems that everyone has an intense 
                    desire to become the absolute best at one very specific thing. (These days a lot of people seem to have an odd 
                    obsession with JS related frameworks? Couldn't tell ya why) For myself, I just want to learn about as many things 
                    as I can. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the best at anything I do, but my interests vary so much that 
                    I'd hazard a guess that I'm a very good candidate for a polymath that can most likely out preform most people 
                    at most tasks that my knowledge instersects with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm far from being the most intelligent person I know but, in my opinion, I think the most interesting people I've
                    met were those that had an incredibly wide skillset; One day I hope to be that for someone else. I think back to 
                    some of the greats like the prop masters of yore as well as one of my favorite makers of today that I've had the pleasure 
                    of meeting... Adam Savage being one. It's been a true joy to meet some of these folks and I'm quite thankful that 
                    in all my conversations with them we've been able to glean something from each other. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below you'll see a number of projects I'm either currently working on, are ongoing, or I've just wrapped.
                    You'll notice that these projects vary quite a bit and may not have any rhyme or reason behind them. That's
                    okay! That's my intent. I just love being able to learn and do things. This ranges from SDR, game development,
                    3D design, FPGA, interpreter creation, woodworking, metalurgy, sewing, and much much more. I'd like to think that
                    in a former life I was a prop designer based on my list of interests.
                </p>

                    So you have an interest in radio... You've come to the right place. The wild world of analog first caught my
                    interest when I was but a wee lad. Ever since then I've hoped and dreamed for a job where I can use some of 
                    the creativity and flexibility seen in analog tech. Alas, I had one job that dealt with radio communications
                    and the rest have been slowly pushing me into software/data engineering so this has become a hobby for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After finding out about SDR a number of years ago I've slowly been growing my antennas (both homemade and 
                    pre-built). this has allowed me to work on a number of projects, whether it be the starters like finding 
                    radio stations, intercepting air traffic controller communication, following active flights in my area, intercepting 
                    local emergency service communications, and then even to more recent projects like trying to read unencrypted
                    P25 communications, radio-photography through GOES satellites, and even trying my hand at creating a weather 
                    database pipeline using NOAA satellites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's always something to do with SDR and please reach out if you want to nerd out over frequencies, I truly
                    do find this one of the most interesting subjects.

                    Discord Roguelike
                </p>
                <p>
                    While sitting at home during the pandemic I was struggling to find a good project to sit down and do. After a bit
                    of hum and haw I finally landed on making a game... In Discord. This was also BEFORE they announced they were going 
                    to make full fledged games inside of Discord so it seemed somewhat original since I couldn't find a single example 
                    of what I was doing. After some deliberating I decided I wanted full audio support for a complete roguelike experience
                    inside of a channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend of this is largely the same as a normal project, you create your random dungeon, you spawn the creatures 
                    and the treasure, you set your goal, and you're off to the races. I added a couple more things like a boss on level 10,
                    attribute leveling, weapons, and a 5e based RNG combat system. It came together fairly nicely, the only tricky thing
                    was dealing with Discord. I needed to have it so that other people couldn't screw you over in chat, if multiple people
                    wanted to play I needed profiles with saves, and I also needed a timeout in case someone left discord for the day and 
                    someone else decided they wanted to grind a bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all I think it took me a couple months to get the first version done which worked pretty well. Ever since then I
                    jump into the code base to clean it up, add some new features, fix some bugs, and try to make it run a bit better. It's 
                    not perfect, and I definitely break it more than anything else, but it was a fun project and a good way to learn some 
                    python that I otherwise wouldn't have known.

                    I don't have much to say about this one other than so far it's been awesome to go back to my roots and deal with some 
                    low level learning. Dealing with 6502 architecture is a ton of fun and I'm looking forward to implementing some
                    emulator features once I can get some of the more complex parts of the NES done.

                    Lox Implementation
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ahhh lox. I remember reading Robert Nystroms "Game Design Patterns" book when I was in college and falling in love 
                    with his style (don't look at me like that, it's not weird...). When I started reading his "Crafting Interpreters"
                    bible I couldn't put it down. Something that I never knew I was interested in all of a sudden just clicked and I 
                    knew I had to try to make this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Crafting an interpreter that someone else is showing you STEP BY STEP how to create... Is still hard. It took me 
                    far too long to understand some of the concepts he was talking about. This is also WITH experience doing exactly
                    what he's trying to teach me. Some CS concepts are just hard to grasp (might also just be me). Regardless with some 
                    serious work and probably too many hours, I finished my Java implementation and immediately got started on his final 
                    implementation: C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think I had a lot more fun in C than I did with Java, in part to me enjoying the language more. While no one really 
                    fully understands C it feels more at home to an embedded programmer like myself. Anyways, I could chat about my 
                    struggles, triumphs, and joys with this book (and I still might one day) but for now I'll just say: "Go read it!"
